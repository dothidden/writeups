* Open the ipv6Evil capture with wireshark
* The challenge description and title give us good hints:
    * DNS Buffer Overflow is not for everyone !
    * Ipv6 evil
* We can deduce that we need to look to a bad ipv6 request that causes DNS buffer overflow
* Use the filter ipv6 and sort the result by size ( a buffer overflow packet is supposed to have a large and unusual
  size due to the added padding
* Check every result by starting from the heaviest packet
* Check the ASCII result of each packet you should see some unusual results with a lot of "A"
* Unfortunately the first one is not the right flag see image

* Continue to check the others
* By going from the heaviest to the lightest packet we notice some other unusual strings:

* If we concate all those strings we get: We_Ar3_N0t_th3_Same what makes sense
* Now do not forget to encrypt it with sha256 and now you got the flag
