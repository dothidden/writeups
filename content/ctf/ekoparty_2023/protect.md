## Challenge Description

So, because we wrote this writeup kinda late, we don't have the original description anymore. The idea is that some binary on the EKONET (which was some online file server you could access through Gopher) was modified in some way, to be different than its intended, original version. That was what the original description implied.

## Intuition

There was a binary called ``protect.exe`` which fit too well with the name of the challenge. On inspection, we find a copyright string leading us to [this website](https://darkside.com.au/snow/). It's a cool, open-source text steganography tool called *Snow*, that can hide (and even encrypt) your message in the whitespaces of text. Maybe we can compile the source files ourselves and compare with the ``protect.exe`` binary.

## Solution

After compiling and opening both binaries side-by-side in Ghidra, we can manually rename the functions and variables in the stripped ``protect.exe`` binary. We notice the decoding and decryption routines are completely missing in the EKONET version. Trying to run them indeed proves nothing is being executed for them. Initially this is where we lost the track, because there didn't seem to be anything different going on. Later on, we started looking through the ``.data`` section, scrolling for any other clues, when we noticed that Ghidra decodes some ASCII in the ``sxor`` bit of the ``ICE sbox``. We notice each byte of the flag is used as a 4-byte value in the sbox.

How the ``ice_sxor`` looked in Ghidra:
