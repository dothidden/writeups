## Challenge Description

I swear I knew what the flag was, but I can't seem to remember it anymore... can you dig it out from my inner psyche?

## Intuition

Let's open first the program using `ghidra` and see what we can find.

It seems the flag is split into different parts into the stack.

## Solution

We can start looking at the first offset `local_98` which is the `lactf{no` string in the Ghidra representation where this input is used int the `strncmp` function. Then because the 
stack use the _LIFO_ method, we have to reconstruct the flag by taking the highest offset after `local_98` which is
`acStack_90`, then `acStack_88` and so on. By looking on all those offset we can find the flag.

### Flag

`lactf{not_what_forgive_and_forget_means}`
