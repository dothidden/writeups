## Challenge Description

I found this google form but I keep getting stuck in a loop! Can you leak to me the contents of form and the message at the end so I can get credit in my class for submitting? Thank you!


## Intuition

If I submit the form, I keep having to fill it out again. So maybe I can find something in the source code ?

## Solution

If we look in the source code, in the script tag, we can see the that the flag is hidden in two parts.

### Flag

`lactf{l34k1ng_4h3_f04mz_s3cr3tz}`
