## Challenge Description

One..... by.......... one............... whew I'm tired, this form is waaaaaaay too long.

Note: the flag does have random characters at the end - that is intentional.

## Intuition

I may have to use the same technique as in the [Infinite loop](/la_ctf_2024/infiniteloop/) challenge, so let's look at the source code.

## Solution

In the script tag, we see a huge list of characters that we can choose from the select. I quickly noticed a weird 
pattern where all characters have the same number except one per list. By taking note of the character with the different number for every list, I was able to reconstruct the flag.

Putting the script in a beautifier can help.
