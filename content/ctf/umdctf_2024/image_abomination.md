## Challenge Description

paul gave his mentat an encrypted thirst trap jpeg bitstream. the mentat was supposed to decrypt and give to chani, but he must've corrupted it along the way. can you help chani thirst over paul?

## Intuition

We get a ``flag.jpg``. It's corrupted. Usually you can trivially fix the issues by checking the jpeg format, maybe with help from [corkami](https://github.com/corkami/pics). This time the issue seems a bit more complicated.

## Solution

While exploring the jpeg, [Koyossu](https://github.com/SecioreanuStefanita) found this [cool script for jpeg analysis](https://github.com/DidierStevens/Beta/blob/master/jpegdump.py). We opened the image in GIMP and we got an error that said ``unexpected marker f7`` or something like that. We deduced there might be weird markers in the jpeg that were corrupting it. So we removed any unknown markers, after identifying them with ``jpegdump.py``:

```
$ ./jpegdump.py --dump flag.jpg

You can see the weird unrecognized markers at lines 13, 15, 17, 19, 23... We also notice the APP4 marker, ``ffe4``. I'm unsure if that's normal, but we deduced that APP4 marker should actually be a RST5 marker, seeing how there's only RST sections in consecutive order. So we changed that ``ffe4`` to a ``ffd5``. That fixed some of the final strips of the flag and gave us enough to see the flag. Here is the script that patches everything:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

delete_this = [0x61, 0xf7, 0x99, 0x52, 0x5d, 0xcb]

img = open("./flag.jpg", "rb").read()

new_img = []

skip_two = False # skip two bytes

for i in range(len(img)):
    if skip_two:
        skip_two = False
        continue
    if img[i] == 0xff:
        if img[i+1] in delete_this:
            skip_two = True
            continue
        if img[i+1] == 0xe4:
            new_img.append(0xd5)
            continue
    new_img.append(img[i])

open("./patched.jpg", "wb").write(bytearray(new_img))
```
