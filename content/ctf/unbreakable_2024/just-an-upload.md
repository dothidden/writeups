## Challenge Description

Our team captured this traffic. Can you find what's in there ?

## Intuition

We got a `pcap` file, let's open it with `Wireshark` and see what's inside. The capture contains a lot of traffic and different
protocols. Therefore, let's filter the traffic by protocol. As we can notice below, it seems someone uploaded a zip file
under HTTP which is not encrypted. Furthermore, the call is made from `/upload.php` which is a big hint coming from
the challenge name.

## Solution

In the wireshark menu we can go to `File -> Export Objects -> HTTP` and we can see the zip file that was uploaded.
I can save them all on my computer and I will use `binwalk` to extract the contents of the zip file.
